                <h1 class="subtitle">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a freshman at Emerald High and it has always been an interest of mine to pursue some sort of Computer Science path.
                    Even though this portfolio is only the beginning of my journey I hope that it can be a start to something great and 
                    enjoyable for me. For me, programming has always seemed like a very hard skill to learn and perfect. By starting small
                    and actually trying to come up with and do my own projects I have been able to start learning and it has been very aspiring 
                    so far. For the future I don't have any specific career path that I have decided to commit to and follow yet. As I
                    have already mentioned I only started coding this year so there have not been many projects that I was able to complete 
                    since many seemed too far out of my range yet.

                        <li><span>Password Manager</span><br>This was my team's final project for CSE, and we collaborated on making a downloadable password manager that works on your local computer. It is able to encrypt and decrypt passwords, as well as delete them from the file completely. It is a secure and easy-to-use password manager that we spent almost a month working on, and I was the group leader for the whole project.</li>
                        <li><span>Autoclicker</span><br>"I was in need of an autoclicker, but I didn't want to download a shady one off the internet. So, I decided to make my own simple one using my keyboard to both start and stop it. You can customize it by adjusting the time between each click and whether the right or left click is triggered. It wasn't a hard project to make, but I had fun doing it.</li>
                        <li><span>Personal Portfolio website</span><br>You're already looking at this projectâ€”it's my own portfolio. It has been one of the most time-consuming projects I've undertaken because of all the animated sliders and making the CSS look nice yet I still enjoyed making it a lot.</li>
